# Blepharisma - IB Diploma Extended Essay 
Blepharisma are single-celled organisms that have the ability to consume other members of their
species. Those that engage in cannibalism become giants, creating a distinct polymorphism of
two possible states- either regular dwarf or cannibalistic giant. The exact conditions in the
environment that give rise to this cannibalistic behaviour, in blepharisma and other cannibalistic
species, has been the subject of some speculation and study. However, it has been suggested that
a game-theoretic approach may be appropriate for determining when individuals may choose to
engage in cannibalism. In this paper, a game-theoretic model of the dynamics of cannibalism
within Blepharisma populations is created by incorporating best response dynamics into a
discrete time population model. The model is used to test the effects of both total resource
availability and population density on the prevalence of cannibalism, finding that increasing
either of these environmental factors increases cannibalistic behaviour. It also reveals that
cannibalism can have implications on total population size. Furthermore, it is possible, under
certain conditions, for the modelled population to arrive at an equilibrium in which the entire
population is either purely cannibalistic or non-cannibalistic rather than a coexistence of both
states, and these conditions are mathematically solved for.
